# World Layoffs Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for cleaning and exploring world layoffs data for the year 2020 - 2023.

After cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from the data.

## Data Cleaning Process
- **Step 1: Duplicate Removal:** Identified and removed duplicate entries using row numbers.
- **Step 2: Standardization:** Addressed inconsistencies in company names, industry labels, and country names.
- **Step 3: Null Values Handling:** Handled null and blank values in the industry column by tracing industry information from other records.
- **Step 4: Column Deletion:** Removed unnecessary columns that didn't contribute to the analysis.
